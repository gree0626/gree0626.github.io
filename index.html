  <p>One interesting thing I did over the break was leave my house for once. Yes, it was just to take out the recycling. However, it gave me a chance to see what 
    I've really been missing over these past few months. Unfortunately, it was 11pm at night and the snow obscured all nearby streetlights. 
    I suppose there will always be another day. Perhaps in a few more months even. More notable, I also tried digital matte painting
    but the results were underwhelming. Hopefully with some practice I will improve my skills in that area a little more.
